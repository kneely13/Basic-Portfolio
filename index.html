            <p>I am currently living in Berea, Ohio, and have just graduated from Notre Dame College in May, 2018, located in South Euclid, Ohio. Concluding my four years attending NDC, I earned my Bacholers of Arts Degree in Management Information Systems and have an interest in the field of Web Development and Cyber Security. Prior to College, I attended Trintiy Highschool, where I was introduced to the technology field through their internsip program involving Information Technology, Graphic Design, Medical, and College Career readiness. After my choice of the Information Technology Department, I was exposed to the Hardware side of computers and apart of internships both at the highschool, St. Bridgets elementery school of Parma, and the Cleveland Muesium of Art. In College, I was introduced to web development through a workstudy job with the web development team where I started to get exposer to coding and the basics. After a college web development/graphic design internship at the Kelvin Smith Library of Case Western University, I wanted to exapnd my knowledge in coding by attending the Case Westerns Coding Bootcamp where I will get the expereience to become a good coder, and use these skills to enhance my career choices further down the road.</p>

            <p>Some of my hobbys include travelling, skiing, coding, playing the Alto Saxophone, spending time with friends, and excersize. I enjoy watching sports and played Ice Hockey throughout my childhood until college. During Highschool and College, I was apart of the marching band as well as concert band. During my freshman year of College, I was part of the Notre Dame College Indoor Winds Ensamble, a seperate group representing the college who competed against other groups around Ohio to later make it to WGI World Championships in Dayton. WGI is a travelling competition of indoor marching bands throught the world, where one is judged off overall performance, music, uniqueness, and phyisucal technique.</p>
